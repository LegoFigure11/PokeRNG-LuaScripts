### FRLG Initial Seed Bot Instructions
Due to the rapidly advancing method of generation of Initial Seeds in these games, a Bot that cycles for a desired Initial Seed is provided

To use it start by opening the script and editing it with your desired Initial Seeds at ``local botTargetInitSeeds =`` in hexadecimal values (preceded by 0x)

After that open your game, load the script and navigate to the Initial Seed Mode. Once you're at the 'Press Start' screen follow the on-screen script instructions to start the bot

### FRLG/E TID Bot Instructions
Due to the rapidly advancing method of generation of TID in these games, a Bot that cycles for a desired Trainer ID is provided

To use it start by opening the script and editing it with your desired Initial Seeds at ``local botTargetTIDs =`` in decimal values

After that open your game, load the script and navigate to the TID Bot Mode. Make your way through the 'New Game' dialogue until you're at the screen where you name your character. After you've given yourself a name, hover with the cursor on the 'END' option; once there follow the on-screen script instructions to start the bot
